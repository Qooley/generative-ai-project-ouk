## ⚙️ Setup  

Clone and prepare the environment:  
```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Qooley/generative-ai-project-ouk.git
cd generative-ai-project-ouk

# create virtual environment (custom name allowed, e.g., genai-env)
python3 -m venv genai-env
source genai-env/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
# OR
genai-env\Scripts\activate      # Windows PowerShell

# upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ▶️ Running Examples

# Run a Jaclang script:

jac run src/tutorials/week1_hello_world.jac

# Run a Python assignment:

python src/assignments/task1_solution.py
